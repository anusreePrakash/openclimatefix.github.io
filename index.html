      <p>Open Climate Fix is a new non-profit research and development
      lab, totally focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions as
      rapidly as possible. Every part of the organisation is
      designed to maximise climate impact, such as our open and
      collaborative approach, our rapid prototyping, and our attention
      on finding scalable &amp; practical solutions.</p>
      <p>By using an
      open-source approach, we can draw upon a much larger pool of
      knowledge and skills than any individual company, so combining
      existing islands of knowledge and accelerating progress. Our
      approach will be to:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
			<p>Search for <abbr>ML</abbr> (Machine Learning) problems where, if we solve a
			well-defined <abbr>ML</abbr> task, then there&#39;s likely to be a large
			climate impact. Then, for each of these challenges,
			  we&#39;ll:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
			<p>Collate &amp; release data, and write software tools to make
			  it super-easy for people to consume this data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
			<p>Run a collaborative &#39;global research project&#39; where
			everyone from 16-year-olds to PhD students to corporate research
			labs can help solve the <abbr>ML</abbr> task (and, over the last 6 weeks,
			I&#39;ve received over 300 emails from people who&#39;d love to
			  get involved).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
			<p>Once the community has developed good solutions, help to put
			those into production, so we can be reducing emissions
			ASAP.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Our first area of focus: Solar Photovoltaics</h2>

      <p>Solar <abbr>PV</abbr> (Photovoltaics) is the largest source of uncertainty in electricity
      system operators&rsquo; forecasts. If a dark cloud moves
      across the sky, the grid can be taken by surprise and lose
      hundreds of megawatts of <abbr>PV</abbr> generation within minutes. This
      lost <abbr>PV</abbr> generation must be replaced immediately. But thermal
      generators take hours to spin-up from cold. The end result is
      that, whenever the sun is shining, the grid keeps lots of
      spinning-reserve online: mostly gas turbines, which are kept
      idling, but not generating electricity. This is expensive
      and carbon intensive.</p>
      <p>The grid would require less spinning reserve
      if they had better <abbr>PV</abbr> forecasts for the next few hours. That is,
      better <abbr>PV</abbr> forecasts would reduce carbon emissions, and save
      money. In the UK, better <abbr>PV</abbr> forecasts should save &pound;1-10
      million per year
      (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jamie_Taylor7/project/PV-Live/attachment/58342d5c08ae5e4c8b365783/AS:431187387785227@1479814492614/download/JamieTaylor_PV_Live_v1_20161122.pdf">Taylor
      et al, 2016</a>), and about 100,000 tonnes of
      CO<sub>2</sub> per year. Scaled up globally, the carbon
      savings should be of the order of tens of millions of tonnes per
        year.</p>

      <h3>Solar <abbr>PV</abbr> 'nowcasting' (forecasting a few hours ahead)</h3>

      <p>We plan to build better <abbr>PV</abbr> nowcasts by tracking clouds from
      satellite images, and &lsquo;rolling&rsquo; those images forwards
      in time using a combination of conventional numerical weather
      predictions, and machine learning.</p>
      <p>We&rsquo;ll use all
      available information about the winds at each cloud&rsquo;s
      altitude, and teach our machine learning model how clouds
      &lsquo;evolve&rsquo; over time.</p>
      <p>We are excited to apply an
      open-science approach to the nascent area of <abbr>PV</abbr> forecasting to
      achieve a step-change improvement in forecasting accuracy, and
        hence to help fix climate change.<p>

      <h3>Solar <abbr>PV</abbr> mapping</h3>
      <p>We'd like to support
      the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
      community to map the location of the world's <abbr>PV</abbr> panels in
      OpenStreetMap.  (OpenSteetMap is like the Wikipedia of maps:
      anyone can edit the database.)  We plan to use a combination of
      machine learning and the wisdom of the crowd to locate <abbr>PV</abbr>
      panels.</p>

      <h2>The founders</h2>

      <h3>Jack Kelly</h3>

      <p>Jack Kelly is terrified by climate change and is determined to
      do everything in his power to reduce emissions, and so he has been
      applying machine learning to climate change mitigation for about
      ten years.</p>
      <p>Jack left Google DeepMind in December 2018 to build
      Open Climate Fix. At DeepMind, Jack worked as a research
      engineer working
      on <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy/">using
      neural networks to predict wind power</a>.</p>
      <p>Prior to
      DeepMind, Jack did a PhD and postdoc at Imperial College London on
      electricity disaggregation. During his academic work, Jack
      collected and released
      the <a href="http://jack-kelly.com/data/">UK&rsquo;s largest
      dataset of domestic appliance-level electricity consumption</a>,
      he was the first
      to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2821650.2821672">apply deep
      learning to disaggregation</a>, and he was co-founder and one of
      three lead developers on the most
      popular <a href="http://nilmtk.github.io/">open-source framework
          for electricity disaggregation</a>.</p>

      <h3>Dan Travers</h3>
      <p>Dan Travers has moved to part time in his
      role as Senior Vice President of Product Management in financial
      markets software in order to work on solar energy forecasting in
      which he is currently a part-time PhD student at University of
      Sheffield.</p>
      <p>Dan has 20 years of experience working in data
      analysis and analytic software engineering for energy and
      derivative markets trading and risk management, and now has a
      passion for using his vast experience to help to mitigate
      climate change.</p>
      <p>Dan previously worked in an electricity trading
      and supply firm in Australia and has a Masters in Mathematics.</p>
